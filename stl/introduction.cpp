/* STL : Standart Template Library 
This is a C++ specific library that contains tools for dealing with data 

STL includes : 
  Containers (vectors,lists,maps) used to store data 
  Algorithms (data processing) used to perform logical actions on data stored in containers
  Functor( customized user algorithms ) used to create user defined functions
  Iterators ( universal container traversal / navigation) 

STL is efficient because :
  it is based on templates that allow to write generic code 
  (that works across different datatypes)
