# My DSA Journey in C++

This repository documents my **learning of Data Structures and Algorithms using C++**, structured term by term. Each term contains exercises, tests, and exams, organized to track my progress.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each term follows the same layout:

```
termX/
    topic/        # Concepts and theory notes they can be multiple
    exercises/    # Practice programs for the listed topics
    cat/          # Continuous Assessment Test for the term
    exam/         # Term exams
```

### Term 1 Highlights

```
term1/
    C++_Basics/
    Recursion/
    OOP_Cpp/
    Pointers_and_References/
    Algorithm_Analysis/
    ADTs/
    exercises/
    cat/
    exam/
```

- Term 1 focuses on building **strong C++ foundations** and understanding core DSA concepts.

## 🚀 How to Run Programs

Each program is **self-contained**. Compile and run using:

```bash
g++ <filename>.cpp -o <output-name>
./<output-name>
```

> Use the provided `Makefile` to clean `.exe` files after compilation.
